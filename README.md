# Citibike-Tableau-Story
Citibike data from 2018 was cleaned in Jupyter Notebook and then analyzed in Tableau. First, null values were removed from the dataset. Next, a second dataset was created isolating subscribers and short-term customers for analysis on these variables. The questions I chose to answered are featured in the story (see below). I chose to include my analysis in the visuals.
